Introduction
============

As a computational biologist I want to be able to rapidly explore microscopy
data in a programmatic fashion so that my exploratory work becomes reproducible
and so that it can more easily be converted into work-flows and web
applications.

Exploring microscopy data involves several, often iterative, steps:

  - Reading in microscopy data
  - Visualising the image stacks to qualitatively understand the data
  - Transforming the image stacks; to enable
  - Extraction of quantitative data
  - Writing up a summary of the findings and sending it to collaborators
  - Automate and scale the analysis to a large set of microscope data
